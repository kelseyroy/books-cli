      "description": "A deluxe trade paperback edition of The Great Gatsby, a true classic of 20th-century literature and one of America’s best-loved and iconic novels. This edition of The Great Gatsby has been updated by F. Scott Fitzgerald scholar James L.W. West III to include the author’s final revisions and features a note on the composition and text, a personal foreword by Fitzgerald’s granddaughter, Eleanor Lanahan—and an introduction by two-time National Book Award winner Jesmyn Ward. Featuring the iconic original cover art and French flaps, this is a must-have for all Gatsby fans. The Great Gatsby, Fitzgerald’s third book, stands as the supreme achievement of his career. First published in 1925, this quintessential novel of the Jazz Age has been acclaimed by generations of readers. The story of the mysteriously wealthy Jay Gatsby and his love for the beautiful Daisy Buchanan, of lavish parties on Long Island at a time when The New York Times noted “gin was the national drink and sex the national obsession,” it is an exquisitely crafted tale of America in the 1920s.",

Scott Fitzgerald wrote some of the most acclaimed novels of the 20th century, and literary scholars regard him as one of the finest American writers of all time. His stories were the stories of the “Lost Generation,” Americans who came of age after World War I, amid Prohibition and the rise of jazz, and who responded to the uncertainty and change of the time by living each day to the hilt. Included in this attractive, leather-bound volume of Fitzgerald’s most notable long-form works are tales of wealth, romance, and scandal: The Great Gatsby, This Side of Paradise, and The Beautiful and Damned. It’s a time capsule of America in the 1920s and 1930s.",

      "description": "A must-have new edition of one of the great American novels--and one of America's most popular--featuring a new introduction by Min Jin Lee, the New York Times bestselling author of Pachinko, and a striking new cover that brings the quintessential novel of the Roaring Twenties into the 2020s A Penguin Classics Deluxe Edition Young, handsome, and fabulously rich, Jay Gatsby seems to have everything. But at his mansion east of New York City, in West Egg, Long Island, where the party never seems to end, he's often alone in the glittering Jazz Age crowd, watching and waiting, as speculation swirls around him--that he's a bootlegger, that he was a German spy during the war, that he even killed a man. As writer Nick Carraway is drawn into this decadent orbit, he begins to see beneath the shimmering surface of the enigmatic Gatsby, for whom one thing will always be out of reach: Nick's cousin, the married Daisy Buchanan, whose house is visible from Gatsby's just across the bay. A brilliant evocation of the Roaring Twenties and a satire of a postwar America obsessed with wealth and status, The Great Gatsby is a novel whose power remains undiminished after a century. This edition, based on scholarship dating back to the novel's first publication in 1925, restores Fitzgerald's masterpiece to the original American classic he envisioned, and features an introduction addressing how gender, race, class, and sexuality complicate the pursuit of the American Dream. For more than seventy-five years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world. With more than 2,000 titles, Penguin Classics represents a global bookshelf of the best works throughout history and across genres and disciplines. Readers trust the series to provide authoritative texts enhanced by introductions and notes by distinguished scholars and contemporary authors, as well as up-to-date translations by award-winning translators.",
